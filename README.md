# mangomaldev

A repository dedicated to storing solutions and code snippets for algorithmic and programming challenges encountered on platforms such as **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, **HackerRank**, and other competitive programming sites. Each problem is organized in its own directory with:

- **Solution code** (often in multiple languages)
- **Explanation** of the approach and complexity analysis
Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute your own solutions!
